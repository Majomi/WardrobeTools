# WardrobeTools

WardrobeTools is a simple World of Warcraft addon that streamlines transmog collection. It has two major functions:

* **Mailer**: WardrobeTools adds a button to the default mailbox UI. With one click, WardobeTools examines all BOE armor and weapons in your bags, determines if you have collected the transmog appearance from each, and automatically mails the items to your specified alts that can equip them.

* **AppearanceCollector**: Once your alts have received the mailed items, use **/ac** to show the AppearanceCollector button. Clicking the button will equip an uncollected transmog item, collecting the appearance. Clicking it again will equip the next uncollected item, and so forth, until all appearances have been collected from items in your bags. The last click will swap back to your original equipment.
